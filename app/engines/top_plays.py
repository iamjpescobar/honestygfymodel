"""
Batter ranking scores for the Top Plays panel and the Matchup table.

Built on REAL, LIVE MLB-computed percentile rankings from
baseballsavant.mlb.com (see engines/savant_leaderboard.py), matched by
MLBAM player_id — not name-string matching, not FanGraphs, not this
app's own percentile approximation. This replaced an earlier version
that depended on FanGraphs, which commonly blocks requests from
cloud/dev hosts; Baseball Savant does not have that problem and is
MLB's own first-party data besides.

IMPORTANT — these are still heuristic composite scores (0-100), built
by averaging real percentiles together. They are NOT calibrated
predictive probabilities: nothing here has been backtested against
actual outcomes and graded for accuracy the way a real prediction
model would be. Don't relabel these as "probability" or add a % sign
implying that kind of calibration — every number that FEEDS these
scores is real and live, but the way they're combined is still this
app's own choice, not an official stat.
